# MonkeyBox Assessment - Google Drive Risk Report clone #
__(In progress)__
<br><br>
### Main Functionalities: ###
The __MERN__ application should allow the user to complete the following tasks: <br>
1. **Link Google Drive**:
   - The user can connect to their Google Drive account and access their files.
   - Save the Token in the Backend Database.
2. **Get the Analytics**:
   - The application can retrieve data from the Google Drive account and display analytics such as file type, file size, and storage usage.
   - In future it would also show the links to files and risk counter (making assumptions as of now).
3. **Revoke Google Drive Access**:
   - The user can revoke the Drive Access API from the Application if they no longer want this Application to access their Google Drive data.

### Tech Stack: ###
- Google OAuth 2.0
- Google Developer APIs
- Google Drive APIs
- MongoDB database for storing tokens
- Node.js with Express.js to make the APIs.
- Reactjs to make UI
